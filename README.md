# Crab Island

This is a game I made for the js13kGames game competition. It has very advanced AI, procedurally generated environments, amazing gameplay, very high replay value, state of the art graphics, and even more. Kidding. My code is awful -- the worst. It was built using [kontra.js](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) though, which is pretty fun.

# This looks _amazing_, how do I play?

Just open up the [build/index.html](./build/index.html) file.

# How do I build this thing?

Just run `npm ci`, and then `npm run build`, for a production build or `npm run start` to build in watch mode dans start a server and stuff.
